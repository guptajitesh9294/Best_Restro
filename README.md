# Best_Restro
I have created a simple guide on where to eat based on Foursquare likes, restaurant category and geographic location data for restaurants 
in Mumbai. I will then cluster these restaurants based on their similarities so that a user can easily determine what type of restaurants 
are best to eat at based on Foursquare user feedback.

# Data Requirements
For this project, I will be utilizing the Foursquare API to pull the following location data on restaurants in Mumbai, India:
• Venue Name
• Venue ID 
• Venue Location 
• Venue Category 
• Count of Likes

# Data Acquisition Approach
To acquire the data mentioned above, I will need to do the following: 
• Get geolocator lat and long coordinates for Mumbai, India
• Use Foursquare API to get a list of all venues in Mumbai 
• Get venue name, venue ID, location, category, and likes
